                Help and Documentation are important considerations for user experience.
                An intuitive website may still need to nudge a user's in the right direcion, should they need help.
                It is important for this information to be easily reachable from any point in your website. 
                Users don't necessarily like to read, nor be told what to do, so brevity and ease are helpful.
                When applicable, anticipate when users will need help and ensure that you provide them with the relevant information.
                We will explore the application of types and their subtypes below.

        <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="grid-item">
            <hr/>
                <span id="one" class="scroll-adjust"></span>
                <h1>Proactive Help</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <p class="tops">
                    Proactive help's aim is to prevent issues <i>before</i> there is a problem.
                    As such it usually familiarizes users with an interface.
                    The three scenarios where this is applicable are new users at first launch of interface, novice users gaining proficiency
                    or existing users encountering new/redesigned interfaces. <br/>
                    Within this category, there are two different types of proactive help which we will furth discuss:<br/> Push Revelation and Pull Revelation.
                </p>
                <hr/>
            </div>

            <div class="grid-item">
            <hr/>
                <span id="two" class="scroll-adjust"></span>
                <h1>Push Revelation</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <p class="tops">
                    This first type of assistance isn't specifically relevant to a user's goals.
                    The information being <i>pushed</i>, is outside of the current context and as such, more randomized.
                    As with the green welcome message encountered above, it wasn't necessary for your immediate goal. Like other
                    users who may not want be troubled reading, push revelations should be made to be easily dismissable. 
                    Ignoring to implement this in one's design may frustrate users who are already familiar with your interface.
                </p>

            <div class="grid-item">

                <span id="three" class="scroll-adjust"></span>
                <h1>Pull Revelation</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                <p class="tops">
                    In contrast, pull revelations are contextual to a user's task, providing <i>relevant</i> information.
                </p>
                <img src="images/tooltipsmall.png" />
                <p id="tooltip-p">
                    Different implementation <br>methods include tooltips and <br>contextual overlays.
                </p>
                <p class="below-tooltip">
                    It is better to favour pull revelations over push. As with all proactive help, keeping it short, timely and concise is advantageous.
                    Using verb-oriented phrases, written from the user's perspective will be helpful in implementing this in your design.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="grid-item">
                <p class="tops"> 
                    Reactive Help is provided <i>after</i> a user encounters a problem.
                    This may answer questions, troubleshoot or provide good old documentation for the curious few.
                    Documentation should be comprehensive and detailed, with no assumption made on behalf of the user.
                    Visual aids are very helpful in providing information, both with tutorials/videos and material design.
                    Providing effective search methods (ie grouping related help topics) make finding help easier and more efficient.

                    Great care should be taken to include help and documentation in the design of your website.
                    A user's ability and familiarity varies, so providing help and documentation for a newcomer coming for the first time, 
                    or a pro for 1000th time means a certain balance must be struck.
                    Whether providing non-contextual help on start...
